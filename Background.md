## Problem Context

While it has revolutionized communication and information sharing, it has also facilitated the rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation<mark>(cite)</mark>. Misinformation refers to false or misleading information shared without harmful intent, while disinformation is deliberately created to deceive audiences. The impact of misinformation on social media is profound, influencing public opinion, shaping political discourse, and even affecting public health outcomes<mark>(cite)</mark>.

 The speed and scale at which misinformation spreads on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok make it a significant societal challenge.
 

## Significance of the Study

The impact of social media on misinformation is a critical and growing issue that poses significant challenges to public trust, safety, and informed decision-making. As social media platforms become primary sources of information, they also serve as a platform for the rapid spread of false or misleading content<mark>(cite)</mark>. Misinformation, whether about health, politics, or social issues, can influence public behaviour, affect elections, and inflate public health crises (as seen with COVID-19)<mark>(cite)</mark>. Understanding how misinformation spreads, its sources, and the mechanisms that amplify it is crucial to developing effective strategies to lessen its harmful effects and protect individuals from being misled.
