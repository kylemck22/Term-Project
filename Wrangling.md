In Tableau Prep, I created a union with the crowdsourced.csv file and the groundtruth.csv file. This showed all the answers to the questions as well as the verdict on each statement, ranging from -1 to 1, with -1 being deemed a non-factual statement, 0 being an unimportant factual statement and 1 being a chec-worthy factual statement. I also cleaned the data. The speaker and title of the speaker are also shown, showcasing who is speaking.
